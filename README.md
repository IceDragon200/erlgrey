# Erlgrey

Erlgrey is a Erlang Term Packer (in elixir), it's intention is to provide better compatability with erlang's types than a general purpose solution like MessagePack could provide, while keeping a somewhat simple structure that can be consumed by other languages.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `erlgrey` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:erlgrey, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
